# Klampo_Unity_Game

Simple game made in Unity. Not completely finished.
Almost all parts of the game are made by me, by hand. However, the water is taken from the asset store and the music is a royalty free track from youtube.
Collect wood and stone to build the house using the workbench.

To play use Klampo.exe in Releases/Klampo_Version_1.0/
